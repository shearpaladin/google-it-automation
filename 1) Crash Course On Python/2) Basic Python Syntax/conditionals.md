## Practice Quiz: Conditionals

__Grade received: 100%__

<br>

### Question 1

What's the value of this Python expression: (2**2) == 4?

* 4
* 2**2
* **True**
* False

> You nailed it! The conditional operator == checks if two values are equal. The result of that operation is a boolean: either True or False.

<br>

## Question 2

Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".

```python
def greeting(name):
  if name == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  else:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))
```

> Great work! You're getting the hang of conditionals in Python.

## Question 3

Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?

```python
if number > 11: 
  print(0)
elif number != 10:
  print(1)
elif number >= 20 or number < 12:
  print(2)
else:
  print(3)
```
**2**

> Right on! Our number is 10, which is smaller than 12, so it matches that condition.

## Question 4

Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer. 

```python
print("A dog" < "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 < 100*100)
```

* "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100
* **"A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is larger than 100*100**
* "A dog" is larger than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100*100
* "A dog" is smaller than "A mouse" and 9999+8888 is smaller than 100*100

> You got it! Keep getting Python to do the work for you.

## Question 5

If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

```python
def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = filesize//block_size
    print("Full blocks",full_blocks)
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = filesize%block_size
    print("Partial Block Remainder:", partial_block_remainder)
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        # If there is a remainder let's say 1 then we need 1 additional 4096 block
        return block_size + block_size*full_blocks
    # No remainders then just multiply by full    
    return block_size*full_blocks

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192

#print(calculate_storage(8192)) # Should be 8192
#print(calculate_storage(10000)) # Should be 12288

```

> Awesome! Those were some complicated calculations that you
needed to do, but you did it!
