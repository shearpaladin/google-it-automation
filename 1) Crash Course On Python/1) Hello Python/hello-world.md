### Question 1

What are functions in Python?


* Functions let us use Python as a calculator.
* **Functions are pieces of code that perform a unit of work.**
* Functions are only used to print messages to the screen.
* Functions are how we tell if our program is functioning or not.

> Right on! Python functions encapsulate a certain action, like outputting a message to the screen in the case of print().

## Question 2

What are keywords in Python?

* **Keywords are reserved words that are used to construct instructions.**
* Keywords are used to calculate mathematical operations.
* Keywords are used to print messages like "Hello World!" to the screen.
* Keywords are the words that we need to memorize to program in Python. 

> You got it! Using the reserved words provided by the language we can construct complex instructions that will make our scripts.
