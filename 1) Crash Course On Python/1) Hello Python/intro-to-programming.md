__Grade received: 100%__

Question 1
What’s a computer program?

1 / 1 point

* A set of languages available in the computer


* A process for getting duplicate values removed from a list


* __list of instructions that the computer has to follow to reach a goal__


* file that gets copied to all machines in the network

Correct
You nailed it! At a basic level, a computer program is a recipe of instructions that tells your computer what to do.

Question 2
What’s the syntax of a language?

1 / 1 point

The rules of how to express things in that language


The subject of a sentence


The difference between one language and another


The meaning of the words

Correct
Right on! In a human language, syntax is the rules for how a sentence is constructed, and in a programming language, syntax is the rules for how each instruction is written.

Question 3
What’s the difference between a program and a script?

1 / 1 point

There’s not much difference, but scripts are usually simpler and shorter.


Scripts are only written in Python.


Scripts can only be used for simple tasks.


Programs are written by software engineers; scripts are written by system administrators.

Correct
You got it! The line between a program and a script is blurry; scripts usually have a shorter development cycle. This means that scripts are shorter, simpler, and can be written very quickly.
